# Project Overview

Welcome to the DIY Arcade Cabinet Project! 🎮

This guide will help you build and set up your own arcade cabinet with modern payment processing and game control systems.

## What You'll Build

Imagine walking up to an arcade cabinet, scanning a QR code with your phone, making a payment, and instantly being able to play your favorite game. Your arcade system will:

* Accept payments through a modern payment system
* Control when games start and stop
* Keep track of credits and game sessions
* Run in a cloud environment

## How It Works

Let's break down the main components of your arcade system:

1. The Cabinet Software 🖥️
    * Runs on your arcade cabinet
    * Controls when games start and stop
    * Keeps track of credits
    * Communicates with the cloud

2. The Cloud Service ☁️
    * Handles payments securely
    * Manages game sessions
    * Connects everything together

3. The Payment System 💳
    * Creates payment links
    * Processes payments safely
    * Adds credits to your game

## Technologies You'll Learn

Through this project, you'll get hands-on experience with:

* Python: A popular programming language that's great for beginners
* Docker: A way to package software so it runs the same way everywhere
* MQTT: A messaging system that helps different parts of your arcade talk to each other
* Cloud Services: Learn how to use professional cloud platforms
* Payment Processing: See how real-world payment systems work

## Two Ways to Build

We offer two paths to complete this project:

1. Quick Deploy Path 🚀
    * Best for: Getting up and running quickly
    * Uses pre-built software
    * Focus on setup and configuration
    * Great for learning about cloud services and deployment

2. Custom Build Path 🛠️
    * Best for: Deep learning and customization
    * Build the software yourself
    * Modify and enhance the code
    * Perfect for learning programming concepts
