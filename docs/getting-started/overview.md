# Project Overview

Welcome to the DIY Arcade Cabinet Project! 🎮 

This guide will help you build and set up your own arcade cabinet with modern payment processing and game control systems. Whether you're new to programming or have some experience, we'll walk you through every step of the process.

## What You'll Build

Imagine walking up to an arcade cabinet, scanning a QR code with your phone, making a payment, and instantly being able to play your favorite game. That's exactly what you'll be building! Your arcade cabinet will be able to:

- Accept payments through a modern payment system
- Control when games start and stop
- Keep track of credits and game sessions
- Run in a cloud environment

## How It Works

Let's break down the main components of your arcade system:

1. **The Cabinet Software** 🖥️
   - Runs on your arcade cabinet
   - Controls when games start and stop
   - Keeps track of credits
   - Communicates with the cloud

2. **The Cloud Service** ☁️
   - Handles payments securely
   - Manages game sessions
   - Connects everything together

3. **The Payment System** 💳
   - Creates payment links
   - Processes payments safely
   - Adds credits to your game

## Technologies You'll Learn

Through this project, you'll get hands-on experience with:

- **Python**: A popular programming language that's great for beginners
- **Docker**: A way to package software so it runs the same way everywhere
- **MQTT**: A messaging system that helps different parts of your arcade talk to each other
- **Cloud Services**: Learn how to use professional cloud platforms
- **Payment Processing**: See how real-world payment systems work

## Two Ways to Build

We offer two paths to complete this project:

1. **Quick Deploy Path** 🚀
   - Best for: Getting up and running quickly
   - Uses pre-built software
   - Focus on setup and configuration
   - Great for learning about cloud services and deployment

2. **Custom Build Path** 🛠️
   - Best for: Deep learning and customization
   - Build the software yourself
   - Modify and enhance the code
   - Perfect for learning programming concepts
