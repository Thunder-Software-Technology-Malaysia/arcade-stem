# Payment Flow

Welcome to the payment flow guide! Let's explore how money gets from a player's phone to your arcade cabinet. Let's make this fun! üí∏

## Quick Overview üéØ

Here's the basic flow when someone wants to play your arcade:

1. Player sees QR code on cabinet
2. Scans code with phone
3. Makes payment through Stripe
4. Game starts automatically!

!!! tip "Think of it Like a Vending Machine"
    * The QR code is like the card reader
    * Stripe is like the payment processor inside
    * The coin pulse is like the spiral turning to drop your snack
    * The game starting is like getting your treat!

## Detailed Payment Flow üîÑ

Let's break down exactly what happens in each step:

### 1. QR Code Generation üì±

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Cabinet Display] -->|Shows| B[QR Code]
    B -->|Links to| C[Stripe Payment]
    style A fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#f0f0f0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#e1e1e1,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

* Your cabinet shows a QR code during attract mode
* Each code is unique to your cabinet
* The code contains your cabinet's ID
* QR codes are generated through Stripe

!!! info "How QR Codes Work"
    The QR code contains a special URL that:
    
    * Links to your Stripe payment page
    * Includes your cabinet's ID
    * Sets the correct price
    * Ensures proper tracking

### 2. Payment Processing üí≥

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Player's Phone] -->|Scans| B[QR Code]
    B -->|Opens| C[Stripe Payment Page]
    C -->|Processes| D[Payment]
    D -->|Notifies| E[Your API]
    style A fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#f0f0f0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#e1e1e1,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#d3d3d3,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#c5c5c5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

When a player pays:

1. They scan your QR code
2. Their phone shows the Stripe payment page
3. They enter their payment info
4. Stripe processes the payment
5. Success! Time for the next step

!!! example "Payment Page Example"
    Your payment page shows:
    
    * Your arcade name
    * The price per play
    * Secure payment form
    * Confirmation message

### 3. Webhook Notification üì®

After successful payment:

1. Stripe immediately sends a webhook to your API
2. Your API verifies the webhook is legitimate
3. The webhook contains:
    * Payment amount
    * Cabinet ID
    * Transaction details
    * Timestamp

!!! warning "Security First!"
    Your API always verifies webhooks by:
    
    * Checking the Stripe signature
    * Validating the cabinet ID
    * Confirming the payment amount
    * Ensuring no duplicate processing

### 4. Credit Management üéÆ

Once payment is verified:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[AWS Lambda] -->|Publishes| B[MQTT Message]
    B -->|Delivers to| C[Cabinet Software]
    C -->|Adds| D[Game Credits]
    D -->|Starts| E[Game]
    style A fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#f0f0f0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#e1e1e1,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#d3d3d3,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#c5c5c5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

1. Your API creates a "coin pulse" message
2. EMQX delivers it to your cabinet
3. The cabinet software:
    * Adds the credits
    * Starts the game
    * Updates the display

!!! tip "Credit Calculation"
    Credits are calculated based on:
    
    * Payment amount
    * Your price settings
    * Any active promotions
    * Multi-play discounts

## Message Formats üìù

### Coin Pulse Message

When credits are added:

```json
{
    "machineId": "your-machine-id",
    "credits": 1,
    "timestamp": "2024-07-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Payment Confirmation

What Stripe sends to your API:

```json
{
    "type": "checkout.session.completed",
    "data": {
        "object": {
            "metadata": {
                "machine_id": "your-machine-id"
            },
            "amount_total": 100
        }
    }
}
```

## Error Handling üîß

The system handles various payment issues:

### Payment Failures

If payment fails:

* Player sees clear error message
* No credits are added
* Cabinet stays in attract mode
* Player can try again

### Network Issues

If connection drops:

* Payments are never lost
* System retries message delivery
* Cabinet maintains state
* Records are reconciled automatically

!!! danger "Preventing Double Credits"
    The system prevents duplicate credits by:
    
    * Tracking transaction IDs
    * Verifying webhook signatures
    * Maintaining state records
    * Using idempotency keys

## Testing Payments üß™

You can test the system using:

1. Stripe test cards:
    * Success: 4242 4242 4242 4242
    * Decline: 4000 0000 0000 0002
    * Error: 4000 0000 0000 9995

2. Test webhook events:
