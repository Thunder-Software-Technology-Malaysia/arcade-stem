# Cloud Services

Welcome to cloud services! This is where we'll explore the online systems that power your arcade cabinet. Think of these services as your arcade's behind-the-scenes crew - they handle payments, send messages, and keep everything running smoothly! ‚òÅÔ∏è

## The Big Picture üéØ

Your arcade uses three main cloud services:

```mermaid

    subgraph "AWS Lambda"
        A[API Service]
    end

    subgraph "EMQX Cloud"
        B[Message Broker]
    end

    subgraph "Stripe"
        C[Payment Service]
    end

    C -->|Payment Webhooks| A
    B -->|Delivers Messages| D[Arcade Cabinet]
    D -->|Game Over| B

```

!!! tip "Think of it Like a Restaurant"
    * AWS Lambda is like the waiter taking orders
    * EMQX is like the kitchen intercom system
    * Stripe is like the cash register
    * Your cabinet is like the kitchen cooking up games!

## AWS Lambda ‚ö°

### What it Does

AWS Lambda runs your arcade's API (Application Programming Interface) in the cloud:

* Processes payments from Stripe
* Sends start game signals
* Handles game over messages
* Creates QR codes for payments
* Manages multiple cabinets

!!! info "Why Lambda?"
    Lambda is "serverless" which means:
    
    * You don't manage any servers
    * It runs only when needed
    * Scales automatically
    * Perfect for arcade cabinets!

### Key Features

1. **API Endpoints**
    * `/create-payment-link` - Makes QR codes
    * `/addCredit` - Processes payments
    * `/gameover` - Handles game endings
    * `/status` - Checks system health

2. **Free Tier Benefits**
    * 1 million requests per month free
    * 400,000 GB-seconds compute time
    * Perfect for arcade systems

## EMQX Cloud üì°

### What it Does

EMQX is your messaging system:

* Connects cabinets to the cloud
* Delivers messages instantly
* Handles real-time updates

!!! example "Message Types"
    EMQX handles two main messages:
    
    1. Coin Pulse (Start Game):

    }
    ```
    
    2. Game Over:

    }
    ```

## How They Work Together ü§ù

Let's follow a payment through the system:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Player
    participant S as Stripe
    participant L as Lambda
    participant E as EMQX
    participant C as Cabinet

    P->>S: Makes Payment
    S->>L: Sends Webhook
    L->>E: Publishes Coin Pulse
    E->>C: Delivers Message
    C->>E: Sends Game Over
    E->>C: Updates Display
```

1. **Payment Flow**
    * Player scans QR code
    * Pays through Stripe
    * Stripe notifies Lambda
    * Lambda tells EMQX
    * EMQX messages cabinet
    * Game starts!

2. **Game Over Flow**
    * Game ends
    * Cabinet tells EMQX
    * System resets
    * Ready for next player
