# Technical Glossary

Welcome to your arcade cabinet dictionary! ðŸ“š Here you'll find explanations of all the technical terms used in this project. Don't worry if some of these seem complex at first - we'll explain everything in simple terms!

## Tips for Using This Glossary ðŸ’¡

* **Bookmark This Page**: Come back whenever you see a term you don't understand

* **Learn Gradually**: Don't try to memorize everything at once - learn terms as you need them

!!! tip "Growing Vocabulary"
    Like learning any new language, you'll get more comfortable with these terms as you use them. Don't worry if they seem confusing at first!


## A

### API (Application Programming Interface)
Think of this as a restaurant's menu and ordering system. It's a set of rules that lets different pieces of software talk to each other. In our arcade, the API helps the payment system talk to your cabinet.

### API Gateway
Like a hotel's front desk that directs visitors to the right room. In AWS, it's the service that receives requests from the internet and sends them to the right place.

### AWS (Amazon Web Services)
A collection of cloud computing services - like renting powerful computers over the internet instead of buying them. We use AWS to run our arcade's payment system.

### Attract Screen
The video display you see on an arcade cabinet when nobody is playing. It's like a TV commercial for your game that runs when the cabinet is idle.

## B

### Broker (MQTT Broker)
Like a post office for messages between your cabinet and the cloud. It makes sure messages get delivered to the right place. We use EMQX as our broker.

## C

### Cabinet
The physical arcade machine that holds the screen, controls, and computer. Think of it as your game's house!

### Cloud Computing
Using computers that are somewhere else on the internet instead of right next to you. Like streaming a movie instead of playing a DVD.

### Container
A package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software. Like a lunchbox that contains not just the food, but also utensils and napkins!

### Credit
A unit of gameplay. Like tokens in traditional arcade machines, but digital.

## D

### Docker
A tool that helps package software into containers. It's like a standardized shipping container for code - works the same way everywhere!

### Docker Image
A template for creating containers. Like a recipe that tells Docker exactly how to make your software container.

## E

### Endpoint
A specific URL where your API can be accessed. Like different doors into a building, each meant for a specific purpose.

### Environment Variables
Secret settings that tell your software how to work. Like a recipe's secret ingredients that you don't share publicly.

### EMQX
The messaging system we use to send signals between your cabinet and the cloud. Think of it as a super-fast digital postal service.

## F

### Flask
A Python tool for building web applications. It's like a kitchen that helps you cook up web services quickly!

### Free Tier
The free level of service offered by cloud providers. Like a free trial, but with specific limits on what you can use.

## G

### Git
A system that keeps track of changes in your code. Like a time machine that remembers every version of your homework!

### GitHub
A website where programmers store and share their code. Like Google Drive, but specifically for code.

## L

### Lambda
An AWS service that runs code without needing a full server. It's like having a helper who only works (and charges you) when needed.

### Linux
An operating system (like Windows or macOS) that's free and open source. Your arcade cabinet runs on Ubuntu, which is a type of Linux.

## M

### Markdown
A simple way to format text that looks good when converted to a webpage. Like using emoji and hashtags, but for creating documentation!

### MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
A messaging system that helps machines talk to each other. Like a group chat for your arcade cabinet and the cloud!

## P

### Payment Link
A special URL that leads to a Stripe payment page. Think of it as a digital price tag that lets people pay!

### Python
A programming language that's great for beginners. It's what we use to write the software for your arcade system.

## Q

### QR Code
A square barcode that people can scan with their phones. Like a link you can take a picture of!

## R

### React
A tool for building user interfaces on websites. Like LEGO blocks for building web pages!

### Repository
A place where all your code lives. Like a folder on your computer, but with super powers for tracking changes!

## S

### Serverless
A way to run code without managing servers. Like ordering takeout instead of running a whole restaurant!

### SSL/TLS
Security systems that keep internet connections private. Like having a secret code language that only the right computers can understand.

### Stripe
A company that handles payments safely. They process the money when someone wants to play your arcade!

## T

### Terminal
A text-based way to talk to your computer. Like sending text messages to your computer instead of clicking buttons!

### Test Mode
A safe way to try things without using real money. Like playing a game in practice mode!

## U

### Ubuntu
A type of Linux operating system. It's what runs on your arcade cabinet's computer!

### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
The address of a webpage or API endpoint. Like a street address, but for the internet!

## V

### Virtual Environment
A special folder for Python that keeps project software separate. Like having a separate pencil case for each class!

### VSCode (Visual Studio Code)
A program for writing code. Like Microsoft Word, but designed specifically for programming!

## W

### Webhook
A way for one service to notify another when something happens. Like having a friend who promised to text you whenever something specific happens!

### WebSocket
A technology that lets websites have real-time two-way communication. Like a phone call for computers!
