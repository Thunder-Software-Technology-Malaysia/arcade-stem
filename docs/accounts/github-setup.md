# Setting Up Your GitHub Account

Welcome to the GitHub setup guide! If you're taking the Custom Build path for your arcade cabinet, GitHub will help you store and manage your code. Even better - you can collaborate with others! :octocat:

## What is GitHub? :thinking:

GitHub is like Google Docs for code:

* Stores your code safely in the cloud
* Tracks changes you make over time
* Lets you collaborate with others
* Makes it easy to share your work
* Used by real developers worldwide!

!!! info "Why Use GitHub?"
    GitHub helps you:
    
    * Keep your code safe and organized
    * Track all changes to your code
    * Work with others on the same code
    * Share your arcade improvements
    * Build a portfolio of your work

## Before You Start :clipboard:

You'll need:

* An email address
* About 10-15 minutes
* A strong password in mind

!!! tip "Student Benefits"
    As a student, you can get the GitHub Student Developer Pack for free! We'll show you how to get this later.

## Setting Up Your Account :wrench:

### 1. Create Your Account

1. Visit [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
2. Enter your email address
3. Create a password
4. Choose a username
5. Complete the verification puzzle

!!! tip "Choosing a Username"
    Pick a professional username! This might be part of your portfolio later.
    Good examples:
    * jsmith-dev
    * jane-parker-code
    * john-arcade-2024

### 2. Verify Your Email

1. Check your email
2. Click the verification link
3. Sign in to GitHub

### 3. Set Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

This extra security step is important:

1. Go to Settings → Password and Authentication
2. Choose "Enable two-factor authentication"
3. Select your preferred 2FA method:
   * Authenticator app (recommended)
   * Text messages

!!! warning "Save Your Recovery Codes"
    GitHub will give you recovery codes - save them somewhere safe!

## Creating Your First Repository :file_folder:

### What's a Repository?

Think of a repository (or "repo") as a project folder that:
* Stores all your code
* Tracks all changes
* Can be shared with others

### Create a Repository

1. Click the '+' icon in the top right
2. Select "New repository"
3. Name it (e.g., "arcade-project")
4. Add a description
5. Choose "Public" or "Private"
6. Initialize with a README

!!! tip "Public vs Private"
    * Public: Everyone can see your code (good for sharing and learning)
    * Private: Only you and people you invite can see it

## Installing GitHub Desktop :computer:

GitHub Desktop makes it easy to work with GitHub:

1. Download GitHub Desktop:
   * [Windows/Mac Download](https://desktop.github.com)

When using GitHub, you'll use these basic commands:

```bash
# Download your repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo

# Save your changes

git commit -m "Describe your changes here"

# Upload to GitHub
git push
```

!!! tip "Using GitHub Desktop"
    GitHub Desktop gives you buttons for all these commands - no typing needed!
